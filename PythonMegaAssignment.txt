Q26. What is a string? How can we declare string in Python?

  -> A string is a series of characters. In Python, anything inside quotes is a string.
     We can use either single or double quotes to declare a string in python.
     For example: message = 'This is a string in Python' message = "This is also a string"
     
Q27. How can we access the string using its index?

  -> We can access the string using the index number of each character in string.
     for ex - str1 = "Omkar"
            print(str1[0])
            print(str1[1])
            print(str1[2])
            print(str1[3])
            print(str1[4])
          
 Q28. Write a code to get the desired output of the following
      string = "Big Data iNeuron"
      desired_output = "iNeuron"
      
      -> code :   string1 = "Big Data iNeuron"
                  print('desired_output = "',string1[9: ],'"')
                  
 Q29. Write a code to get the desired output of the following

      string = "Big Data iNeuron"
      desired_output = "norueNi"
      
      -> Code : string1 = "Big Data iNeuron"
         print('desired_output = "',string1[ -1: -8 :-1],'"')
         
 Q30. Resverse the string given in the above question.

      -> Code : string1 = "Big Data iNeuron"
         print('desired_output = "',string1[ -1 : : -1],'"')
          
 Q31. How can you delete entire string at once?

      -> We can delete a entire string using the keyword 'del'. syntax : del stringname
         for ex - string2 = "sample string"
         del string2
         
 Q32. What is escape sequence?

     -> An escape sequence is a sequence of characters that, when used inside a character or string, does not represent itself but is converted into             another character or series of characters.
        Character combinations consisting of a backslash (\) followed by a letter or by a combination of digits are called "escape sequences."
        To represent a newline character, single quotation mark, or certain other characters in a character constant, we must use escape sequences.
        for ex - \' - single quote, \\ - backslash, \n - new line, \t - Tab, \b - backspace
        
  Q33. How can you print the below string?
 
     'iNeuron's Big Data Course'

      -> string4 = "\'iNeuron\'s Big Data Course\'"
         print(string4)
         
  Q34. What is a list in Python?

      -> List is used to store multiple items in a single variable.
         A list can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, string, etc.).
         A list can also have another list as an item. This is called a nested list.
         
  Q35. How can you create a list in Python?
  
      -> In Python, a list is created by placing elements inside square brackets [] , separated by commas.
         for ex - list1 = [1,2,3,4,'omkar','rane','good',6,7,8]
         
  Q36. How can we access the elements in a list?

      -> We can access the elements in a list by using the index number of a certain element in the list.
         for ex - list1 = [1,2,3,4,'omkar','rane','good',6,7,8]
                  print(list1[0])
                  print(list1[1])
                  print(list1[2])
                  print(list1[3])
          This print statements will display the first four elemants of the list one by one.
          
  Q37. Write a code to access the word "iNeuron" from the given list.
      lst = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]
       
       -> Code :  lst = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]
                  newlist = list((lst[4]))
                  print(newlist)
                  print(newlist[2])
                  
  Q38. Take a list as an input from the user and find the length of the list.
  
      -> Code : list5 = []
                n = int(input("Enter the number of elements to be insertes in a list: "))

                  for i in range(0,n):
                      param = input("Enter the elemenst in the list: ")
                      list5.append(param)
                  print(list5)
                  print(type(list5))
                  print("The length of list is:",len(list5))
                  
   Q39. Add the word "Big" in the 3rd index of the given list.
      lst = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]

      -> We can achieve this using the insert() funtion in the code.
      Code : lst = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]
             lst.insert(2, "Big")
             print(lst)
